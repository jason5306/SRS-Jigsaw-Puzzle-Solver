## Progress

1. Read the documentation of `cv2.cornerHarris` and understand the theory behind it.
2. Successfully detect more than 4 corners for all test images
3. Filter four best corners from the detected ones based on the strategy:
   1. the angle formed by three corners, the more close to 90 degrees, the better
   2. the larger the area formed by the four corners, the better
4. Successfully filtered 4 best corners for all test images, the result look robust

## Meeting

To do next:

1. Get subcontour:

   - Compare list result of cv2.findcontour with four corners

   - A method to detect edge

2. Match subcontour

   - interpolation: `numpy.interp`
   - Match angle along the edge
   - Match color along the edge
