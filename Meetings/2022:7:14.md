## Progress

1. take a new image of pieces, with pure white background

   ![pieces2](https://github.com/jason5306/SRS-Jigsaw-Puzzle-Solver/blob/main/Meetings/2022:7:14/pieces2.png)

2. refined contour extraction to get better contours for contour matching, add `opening` to the process

   but it seems there will always be a gap

3. though the `cv2.matchShape` does not design for this problem, I applied it on each piece and got scores, the scores are enough for filtering

   1. but some desired matches are also filtered out

4. write a function to extract color along the contour, for each point on the contour, get two points with a distance of 10 pixels

5. need to find ways to compare colors

   1. fastdtw: https://towardsdatascience.com/an-illustrative-introduction-to-dynamic-time-warping-36aa98513b98
      1. DTW is an algorithm to find an optimal alignment between two sequences and distance metric
   2. others
      1. HSV
      2. average value?

   the direction matters

3. matching

   1. distance of hue
