## Progress

1. Refine subcontour classification

   1. previous idea: closest line

   2. problem with the previous idea: subcontours for some pieces got the wrong classification since the subcontour is close to the wrong line

      1. Fix: “Neighbor”, each point will check whether its neighbors are classified before determining which class it belongs to.

2. Get lists of classified subcontour points

   1. Based on the previous result, which we have a classified region instead of a classified list of points, using “neighbor” idea, determining the class of points along subcontours

   2. Result: get a list of points, one pixel each, of subcontours

3. Explored interpolation and matching

   1. interpolation: not successful, will try explore more

   2. Matching:

      1. SIFT: hard to find matches, maybe try to scale smaller, or use connected contour

      2. cosine similarity: should be rotational invariant? but the similarity score of two rotated gray images of the same piece is not 1

## Meeting

1. Problem: the subcontour points detected by the `cv2.findContour` method is not continuous, as we zoom in

   But if we use the `cv2.drawContour` method, we observe that the contour points are continuous

   To exclude the influence of other code, I created a new notebook to test this problem, but the issue remains, please refer to the mail attachment.
