## Progress

1. Mind map for the project

2. Tried rotation with cv2.minAreaRect, but for some piece, the detected rectangle with the minimum area is not desirable.![Screen Shot 2022-06-04 at 01.14.12](https://github.com/jason5306/SRS-Jigsaw-Puzzle-Solver/blob/main/Meetings/2022:6:3/Screen%20Shot%202022-06-04%20at%2001.14.12.png)

3. Produce individual gray image for each piece

4. Tried corner detection, not desirable.![Screen Shot 2022-06-04 at 01.16.21](https://github.com/jason5306/SRS-Jigsaw-Puzzle-Solver/blob/main/Meetings/2022:6:3/Screen%20Shot%202022-06-04%20at%2001.16.21.png)

## Meeting

1. For subcontour detection, angle of continuous points along the sub contour can be used to determine whether they form a corner.



## TO DO

Dive into the corner detection with `cv2.cornerHarris`, try to make it work.
