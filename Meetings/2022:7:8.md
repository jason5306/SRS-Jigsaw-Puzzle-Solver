## Progress

1. Solved the discontinuous points problem, using `cv2.findContours(binary_rotate,cv2.RETR_TREE,cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_NONE)`

2. refined the contour splitting code to make it work on the one-pixel list of contours

3. Find ways to match the sides of pieces, try `cv2.matchShapes`, the more similar two contours are, the lower the score it generates. The doc says it is rotational invariant.

4.

   I tried on the same side, the result seems good.	

   Then I explored the efficacy of this method on our dataset, and find some problem

5. Problem: the previous contour extracting step is not accurate enough for the matching

## Meeting

1. make cutting better 
2. source code of matchshpe
3. **interpolation**
4. color matching, HSV
