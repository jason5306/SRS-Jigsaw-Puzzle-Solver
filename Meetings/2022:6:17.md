## Progress

1. Detected corners are NOT in the list of contours

2. Find the nearest point in the list of contours for detected corners based on distance, but the problem is that, some new corners are not accurate enough.

How to solve it?

For points along the contour, for each three of them we can fit a line, and get the angle of this line. For all points, we can have a plot of angles, and easily find where the corners are.

For the matching part, the first, and most important step is to interpolate subcontours into the same length.
