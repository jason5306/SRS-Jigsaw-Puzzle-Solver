## Progress

1. Refined corner

   1. Set a window in the detected corner, for the points on the contour in the window, find the point that is furthest to the center of the piece.

2. extract subcontours

   For four lines passing through the four corners, classify each point to its closest line.

## Meeting

1. Major steps
   1. a line for the contour with 1 pixel --> a list
   2. interpolate the list to the same length 
   3. Search for matching
      1. chaincode (method that is rotational invariant)

2. TODO next

   1. Apply the above algorithm to the rest of the pieces, fix problems if needed
   2. Modify the input of the refinement algorithm use cv.contour instead of using erosion, this is because we need subconoturs to be one-pixel width
   3. Interpolate subcontours

3. About the progress this summer

   Initially, the plan for this summer project was to at least apply the puzzle solver to more than 200 pieces. But over the past month, the progress did not meet the expectation. Thus, I believe the current short-term goal is to make contour matching algorithms work for the 20 sample pieces, after that, we can make plans about the ultimate product for this summer. Of course, if possible, I would like to continue working on this after this summer.
